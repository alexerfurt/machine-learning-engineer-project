## Overview
This repo contains all the code I used for the capstone project of [Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). The goal is to plot and navigate a Virtual Maze through an agent - a simulated robot mouse (inspirated from [Micromouse](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse&sa=D&ust=1578346149007000) competitions) using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

You can find the final proposal and report in their respective folders.

## Software Requirements/ Setup
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Run the robot
