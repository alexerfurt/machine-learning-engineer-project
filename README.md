## Overview
This repo contains all the code I used for the capstone project of [Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t). The goal is to create an agent who is able to learn and win at the Connect4 game using Reinforcement Learning techniques. It is inspired by the [Connect X Simulation Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/overview) by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

You can find the final proposal and report in their respective folders.
